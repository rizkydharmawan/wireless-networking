#Project Assignment NS3

#Task
Using NS-3 test IEEE 802.11b performance vs number of stations

#Specifics
* Setup x WiFi nodes in an infrastructure mode (1 Access Point) and  experiment with the all parameters that NS3 WiFi helper allows 
* The more scenarios you can generate-the better! 
* Scripts for inspection: 10 March 
* Write down everything in one script: (i) analysis, (ii) simulations, (iii) plotting 
* Proper result presentation: error bars, many runs to obtain results 
* Use GitHub.com to store your code 
â€¢ Use LaTeX only
